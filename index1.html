      /* 3 will be returned due to "%" being the modulo operator.
    The modulo operator and the division opererator are similar, but the modulo
    operator returns the remainder left after division, whereas the division operator
    will return the result of the division of the two numbers.

      console.log(++num);
      /*
      The first console.log statement logs the num variable to the console.
      AFTER it is logged, the variable is incremented by one, making
      num equal to four. The second console.log statement logs 5 because
      the "++" comes BEFORE the variable, and therefore the varible is incremented
      by one, and THEN logged to the console.
      */
      // 3. Remove the ambiguity from the following line but keep the result
      //    exactly the same.

      console.log(2 * 3 + (3 - 4 / 3));

      // The above code kept autocorrecting.
      // My solution was console.log((2 * 3) + (3 - (4 / 3));
